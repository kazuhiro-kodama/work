### Observation

Although the steps of *"Implement Test Code (A.2-2)"* and *"Prepare Test Data (A.2-3)"* are described in this guide, 
you might notice that there is no *"Execute the Test"* step.

This is because it is assumed that the test is automatically executed, since a CI (continuous integration) tool is being used.
